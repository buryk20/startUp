So let's break it down and understand why the title, description, and keywords are necessary on a website, without using complicated concepts from Wikipedia.",
    'title_2' => 'Now we have come to the answer to this question. The title is one of the key and most important meta tags on a webpage. Writing it correctly will improve your website\'s ranking in search results and attract users. However, if it is composed incorrectly, the effect will be exactly the opposite.',
    'title_3' => 'In this article, I have tried to explain in simple words what the title meta tag is. But these are just basic concepts; in practice, you need to analyze each specific case. You can delve into it yourself or rely on professionals.',

    'whatIsTitle_1' => 'The term "title" implies that it is a heading, but a heading for what? It is not visible on the actual webpage. The title is the page title for search engine robots.',
    'whatIsTitle_2' => 'What does this mean? It means that when a robot visits a webpage, it pays attention to this meta tag first. But where can users see it? Is it only for the robot? The title is crucial for users primarily because it helps them decide whether to visit the site or not.',

    'titleExample_2' => "We could write something like 'Mercedes-Benz Electric Car, Code 12345 - Two-Seater for Kids.' It seems like we wrote everything correctly, but let's see what the user sees.",
    'titleExample_3' => 'In this case, when a customer searches for "electric car," they see our link, click on it, and find something completely different from what they were looking for. As a result, they leave the webpage. You might ask, "So what? They visited and left. What\'s the problem for us?".',
    'titleExample_4' => 'The problem is that if we have a high bounce rate, it means our search result is not relevant, and the search engine will lower our ranking, affecting our position in search results.',
    'titleExample_5' => 'Therefore, it is better to write a title like "Children\'s Electric Car - Mercedes-Benz, Code 12345 - Two-Seater." With such a title, we won\'t mislead users who are only interested in "electric cars."',
